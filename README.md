# stats220
## project 1

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in law and statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn more about using *R Studio*
- I am interested in learning about data technologies and how to **code** 

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://media1.tenor.com/m/JjMoryimPeoAAAAC/spongebob-spongebob-squarepants.gif)

Some hobbies of mine include: 
1. Playing sports
2. Photography (the camera I am currently using is the [Olympus XA2](https://diaxa.com/xa2.htm>))
3. Making coffee/matcha (coffee beans I've been enjoying are from [Eternal Coffee](https://eternalcoffee.co.nz/.))
